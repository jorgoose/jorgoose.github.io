### Background

This project was created to explore the capabilities of image classification models using TensorFlow. The goal was to train a model to identify images of Pokémon, and then use the model to classify images of Pokémon that were not included in the training dataset.

### Results

The model was able to achieve an accuracy of 95% on the test dataset, and was able to correctly classify images of Pokémon that were not included in the training dataset.

### Tech Stack

The model was built using the following technologies:

- **TensorFlow:** TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework that provides a simple and efficient way to build and train machine learning models.

- **Keras:** Keras is a high-level API that provides an intuitive interface for building and training machine learning models. It is built on top of TensorFlow, and provides a simple way to build and train machine learning models.

- **Python:** Python is a high-level programming language that is used for a wide variety of applications, including machine learning and data science.
