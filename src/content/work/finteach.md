## Background

FinTeach was conceived to address the noticeable gap in financial education for younger audiences, especially in underfunded schools. Our goal was to transform the often complex and dull subject of finance into an intriguing, easy-to-understand format for students. This led to the creation of an application that is not just educational but also fun and engaging.

### Challenges

Our journey to creating FinTeach was filled with unique challenges. We navigated through a complete pivot in our project idea to align with the hackathon's themes and grappled with mastering Flutter, a new technology for our team. Our persistence and adaptability were key in overcoming these obstacles.

### Design and Development

FinTeach's user-friendly design was achieved using Flutter, chosen for its cross-platform capabilities, ensuring accessibility on various devices. The app's interface, built with Dart and Material Design, focuses on simplicity and ease of use, keeping our young target audience in mind.

### Tech Stack

FinTeach is developed using Flutter, which allowed us to create a seamless and responsive application across different platforms. Dart was used for programming, providing a strong, yet flexible structure for our app. The Material Design principles guided our UI/UX design, ensuring an intuitive and attractive interface.

### Future Prospects

Looking forward, we aim to enhance FinTeach by introducing adaptive question generation to match user skill levels, expanding topic sub-modules for depth, and incorporating dictation features for inclusivity.
