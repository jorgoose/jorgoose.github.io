## Introduction

> "Just buy something for less than itâ€™s worth." - Warren Buffett

Welcome to EveryNetNet.com, a platform dedicated to bringing you the world of net-net companies. Our mission is to help you discover undervalued companies with great investment potential. Inspired by my passion for investing, capital markets, and the strategies of Benjamin Graham, author of "The Intelligent Investor" and "Security Analysis," as well as Warren Buffett during the early years of his partnership, EveryNetNet.com aims to empower investors with valuable insights and opportunities in the realm of net-net investing.

Net-net investing, a strategy popularized by Benjamin Graham, focuses on identifying companies trading at a significant discount to their net current asset value (NCAV). These undervalued companies often have strong potential for future growth and can provide attractive investment opportunities. Our platform dives deep into the world of net-net investing, providing comprehensive information on companies that meet these criteria.

We aim to be the go-to platform for net-net investing, offering comprehensive data, analysis tools, and educational resources.
